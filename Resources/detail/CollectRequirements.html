									Scope Management Plan:
									<p>The scope management plan provides clarity as to how project teams will determine which type of requirements need to be collected for the project.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Requirements Management Plan:
									<p>The requirements management plan provides the processes that will be used throughout the Collect Requirements process to define and document the stakeholder needs.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Stakeholder Management Plan:
									<p>The stakeholder management plan is used to understand stakeholder communication requirements and the level of stakeholder engagement in order to assess and adapt to the level of stakeholder participation in requirements activities.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Project Charter:

								</li>
								<li>
									Stakeholder Register:
									<p>The stakeholder register is used to identify stakeholders who can provide information on the requirements. The stakeholder register also captures major requirements and main expectations stakeholders may have for the project.</p>

					<h3><a href="#">Outputs</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Requirements Documentation:
									<p>Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project. Requirements may start out at a high level and progressively become more detailed as more about the requirements is known. Components of requirements documentation can include, but are not limited to: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Business requirements</li>
										<li>Stakeholder requirements</li>
										<li>Solution requirements</li>
										<li>Project requirements</li>
										<li>Transition requirements</li>
										<li>Requirements assumptions, dependencies, and constraints</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Requirements Traceability Matrix:
									<p>The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. Tracing includes but is not limited to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Business need, opportunities, goals, and objectives</li>
										<li>Project objectives</li>
										<li>Project scope/WBS deliverables</li>
										<li>Product design</li>
										<li>Product development</li>
										<li>Test strategy and test scenario</li>
										<li>High level requirements to more detailed requirements</li>

					<h3><a href="#">Tools and Techniques</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Interviews
									<p>An interview is a formal or informal approach to client information from stakeholders by talking to them directly.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Focus Groups
									<p>Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Facilitated Workshops
									<p>Facilitated workshops are focused sessions that bring key stakeholders together to define product requirements.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Group Creativity Techniques
									<p>Several group activities can be organized to identify project and product requirements. Some of the group creativity techniques that can be used are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Brainstorming</li>
										<li>Nominal group technique - brainstorming with a voting process</li>
										<li>Idea/mind mapping - mapping brainstorming activities</li>
										<li>Affinity diagram - grouping ideas for review and analysis</li>
										<li>Multicriteria decision analysis - utilizes a decision matrix</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Group Decision-making Techniques
									<p>Group decision-making technique is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. Examples are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Unanimity</li>
										<li>Majority</li>
										<li>Plurality</li>
										<li>Dictatorship</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Questionnaire and Surveys
									<p>Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Observations
									<p>Observations provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Prototypes
									<p>Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a working model of the expected product before actually building it.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Benchmarking
									<p>Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned practices, such as processes and operations, to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Context Diagrams
									<p>The context diagram is an example of a scope model.Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing a business process and how people and other systems interact with it.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Document Analysis
									<p>Document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying information relevant to the requirements.</p>
								</li>
