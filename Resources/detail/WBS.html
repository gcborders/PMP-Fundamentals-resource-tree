		The Create WBS process subdivides project deliverables into work packages, which are smaller and more easily handled. The major benefit of this is the structured vision it produces.	</p>

					<h3><a href="#">Inputs</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Scope Management Plan:
									<p>Explains how the WBS is created from the project scope statement, and how the WBS will be maintained and approved.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Project Scope Statement:
									<p>Outlines what work will and will not be covered during the course of the project. Any restrictions and limitations that may affect the project are also listed.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Requirements Documentation:
									<p>Detailed documentation of requirements is absolutely essential to understand what work needs to be done to produce the project, and exactly what the end project will produce.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Enterprise Environmental Factors:
									<p>There may be external WBS standards that relate to certain projects in specific industries. This must be taken into consideration when creating the WBS.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Organizational Process Assets:
									<p>Organizational policies, procedures, templates, previous project files, and lessons learned from previous projects may have an influence on the WBS process.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						
					</div>
					<h3><a href="#">Outputs</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Scope Baseline:
									<p>The approved scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Project Documents Updates:
									<p>In the process of WBS creation, some project documents may need to be updated. Examples of this are requirements documentation and scope.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<h3><a href="#">Tools and Techniques</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Decomposition
									<p>The process of breaking down the scope and deliverables into work packages. The level of decomposition depends on the amount of control necessary to manage the project. The level of detail in the work packages depends on how complex the project is.</p>
									<p>Decomposition involves:
										<ul>
											<li>
												Identifying and analyzing deliverables and related work
											</li>
											<li>
												Structuring and organizing the WBS
											</li>
											<li>
												Decomposing the upper levels into more detailed packages
											</li>
											<li>
												Applying codes to the WBS components for identification
											</li>
											<li>
												Confirming that the level of decomposition is appropriate
											</li>
										</ul>
									
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									Expert Judgement
									<p>An expert in the field can be used to analyze the information and assist in decomposition. Expert judgement can also be considered to be the use of templates the help direct the breakdown into work packages.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<h3><a href="#">Glossary</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							<dfn>WBS</dfn><br>Short for Work Breakdown Structure, this is a hierarchical decomposition of the work that needs to be completed to finish the project. Higher levels are more vague, and the lower levels are more detailed. Work packages are the lowest and most detailed element of the WBS. Each item in the WBS is assigned an identification number for tracking and organization purposes.
							<dfn>WBS Dictionary</dfn><br>Details of the work required for each work package. This can include activities, milestones, the responsible organization, quality and resource requirements, performance measurement critera, start and end dates, cost estimates, and more.
							<dfn>Work Package</dfn><br>A work package is the smallest unit of work in the WBS. These can be used to “group the activities where work is scheduled, estimated, monitored, and controlled.”
